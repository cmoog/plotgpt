    Plot a simple area chart with Date on the x-axis and Close on the y, filled in with \#ccc.
    Then plot a line with the same variables.
    Then plot a horizontal line at y equals 0. Show the chart grid.

    Plot a simple area chart with Date on the x-axis and Close on the y, filled in with \#ccc.
    Then plot a line with the same variables.
    Then plot a horizontal line at y equals 0. Show the chart grid for the y axis, and
    reverse the y axis direction.

    Plot an area chart and a line with the same variables. Normalize the y axis with
    "median" as the basis. Use "date" as the x axis and "unemployed" for the y axis.
    Make the area chart semi-transparent and the line have stroke width equal to 1.
    Split the chart into facets by "industry".
    Make the height of the chart 600. Don't show the y axis.

    Plot.plot({
      height: 600,
      y: {
        axis: null

        Plot.lineY(data, Plot.normalizeY({basis: "median", x: "date", y: "unemployed", strokeWidth: 1}))
